					<p><strong>Project Abyss: My own website</strong></p>
					<p>
						Project Abyss was something I started on
						<b>06/01/2023.</b>
						(MM/DD/YY) The main point of the website is to be an
						online riddle, otherwise known as an ARG. It's meant to
						be an online intermediate online riddle, meaning around
						the difficulty of something like
						<a href="https://enigmapedia.xyz/" target="_blank">
							nigmapedia.
						</a>
						The website was created after the abandonment of my
						other website, which will be unspecified due to it
						being... really bad. To this day, I am still actively
						working on it, but not mainly. I still have other things
						to do, such as schoolwork. I host this website on a free
						hosting service called
						<a href="https://surge.sh/" target="_blank">Surge.</a>
						It's pretty nice but can shut down a bit often.

					<p><strong>Alex Rider: Book Series</strong></p>
					<p>
						Alex Rider was the second series I picked up while
						trying to get back into reading in Grade 9. The first
						series I read was kind of disappointing, but this one
						was my favorite, and I've read every single book of the
						14-book series so far. The book is basically about a
						British teenage spy helping in all sorts of dangerous
						missions. I guess I'm a sucker for teenage books,
						because I managed to read all of these within the year.
						<br />
						Here's a few things I like about it:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The Action: While there's a few things here and
							there, the action is overall very good.
						</li>
						<li>
							Relatable: The author manages to make the main
							character actually feel like a teenager.
						</li>
						<li>
							Story: It's interactive, entertaining, and makes me
							want to wait for the next book to come out.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Niagara Falls: My vacation</strong></p>
					<p>
						In July of 2024, I went on vacation to many Canadian
						cities, including Toronto. There, I visited Niagara
						Falls, the coolest thing I've seen for a long time. I
						managed to get up close with a tour boat, and it is
						mesmerizing and fun to get splashed on. It's a once in a
						lifetime visit, and I'm glad I got to visit with my
						parents.
